# web scraping with Python using BeautifulSoup by building real world practical projects!

Web Scraping is one of the most important topics in programming and data science.

After I had learned the basics of programming in Python, I was looking to put my skills to practice and I quickly discovered web scraping and I've been hooked ever since. The thought of being able to extract data from all over the web

Web scraping is a tool that's used by many large companies for all kinds of use cases. You can learn web scraping too, I will help you!


In this repository, you can see how to scrape data off some of the most well-known websites which include:

- IMDB

- eBay

- Wikipedia

- and other websites

This repository will be perfect for you if: you are interested to gather data for your machine learning or data science project; you're looking for interesting real world projects to build in Python after learning the basics; automating different tasks for your needs and much more.

After learning the web scraping basics and approaches, you will be able to apply these new-found skills to your own personal projects or to build scrapers for businesses.

Websites can change with time

Technology is moving and evolving extremely fast, so are apps and websites. Whether websites change their styling or even their functionality, they evolve.

Here is an image of the evolution of Facebook since it was created:

It's important to keep this in mind when scraping them as well. Just because you wrote a script to scrape a website and it works today, doesn't mean that it will work in the future as it might change.

While I was scraping IMDB for this part, I got an option to check out the new design which is still in the beta stage, so in the future they might make it the default design and then I'll need to change the code to conform to the new design.

Yet most websites don't change too often because they want to keep their interfaces familiar and intuitive.

I will try to keep the contents of this course as up to date as I can, so that the code remains functional.
