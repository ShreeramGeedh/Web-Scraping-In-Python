There are many ways to implement what I done here for your own needs, or to solve problems that you might encounter while browsing the web.



While eBay provides great search functionality(there are many ways to filter products you want to search for), there are many e-commerce(or other) websites that may not have the search functionality that you need. So instead of wasting your precious time searching for those items, you can, with the knowledge you've gained here, build a web scraper, that goes page to page and gets the products for you based on your criteria.

You can even take this project one step forward and make the script send you the products, together with the links to your email.


***Programming is amazing because it allows us to automate stuff, using web scraping you can do that easily.***


Try building a news aggregator, you can scrape a number of news websites and get the title and a small piece of the article content in order to display from all of the news sites on one single website(your own), this is a good opportunity to learn web development and databases as well.

You can also use cron jobs to run your web scraping script any time you like, without you needing to run the script manually.



***As you can see there are so many things you can do with web scraping, so be creative and don't stop coding!***
